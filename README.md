# Animation and Keyboard

For this Hackathon, our objetive was to use [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).


Finding a good idea to work on was really challenging, and It was my first time working with open source vector graphics scripting framework.

I had a coding/art project mulling about in my head and thought this was a great opportunity to build it. I was thinking to combine canvas, animation and sound. So I decided to create this [project](https://yasamanloghmani.github.io/animation-game/)
