# Animation and Keyboard

For this Hackathon, our objetive was to implement any changes we saw fit to an [existing Hackathon project](https://yasamanloghmani.github.io/animation-game/) which is a piano app which utilizes [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/). 

The existing product combined canvas, animation and sound. To add-on, I implemented several features to improve user functionality.

*To simplify the instructions, the keyboard shortcuts were placed on each cooresponding key.  This should allow most users to play the instrument more intuitively.

*Secondly, to improve the user experience, the app was fixed to not scroll Which is aimed to allow the user to be able to remain focused on the virtual keyboard.  Additionally, the colors were refactored in an effort to stand out more.
